    The first of our fall guest speaker lineup, local indie trio Studio Cypher will present
    __"Diorama Detective: a Mobile-AR Indie Dev Postmortem"__, discussing the design and production
    of their latest release.

    GD@IU will also be holding a brownbag roundtable on all things indie development with Studio Cypher's
    Will Emigh, Nathan Mishler, and Ian Pottmeyer at 5PM. The location is still being decided, so be sure to keep
    an eye on [Slack](https://iu-games.slack.com) for more info.
