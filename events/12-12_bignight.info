    **B**loomington **I**ndie **G**games Night is a monthly get together of local independent game developers.
    Gamedev@IU members are encouraged to come out, show off their work, see what others in the community are making, or just to chat while playing some fresh prototypes!

    BIG Night is the second Thursday of each month, and it replaces any other GD@IU events happening that night.
