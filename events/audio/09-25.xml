	Are you a game designer, developer, musician, composer, or sound designer? Do you want your games to have music and/or sound effects? Do you want to learn about the production process for game-ready audio content?
    ))
	((
	If you answered yes to any of these questions, donâ€™t miss our special guest *Will Savino*, who will be giving a talk in the *Game Lab* at *6PM*! Will has written and produced soundtracks for numerous games and other media projects and will be giving valuable insight into his workflow, and how developers can more effectively work and communicate with composers.
