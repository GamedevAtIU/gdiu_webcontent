    ((
    When a player misses a jump in a game, do certain sounds affect the way the player feels about their mistake? When they collect something, how does the sound change the way a player feels about the collectable? In collaboration with the Design SIG, we will be looking at how designers create scenarios in which sound designers can contribute more to the overall experience as well as creating sounds for scenarios that members of the Design SIG will create.
