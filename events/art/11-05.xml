    In this two part workshop, attendees will be split into small groups and be given a game concept that they will spend two weeks producing assets for.

    ((
    Whether that's concepting characters, modeling assets, or making environment pieces, that's up to you! The goal is a cohesive collection of assets for the game concept.
