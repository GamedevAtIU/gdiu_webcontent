    A longer event in which each person is able to design a character (or use one they previously designed) and create a reference sheet for that character. This would consist of several basic views of the character (Profile Left, Profile Right, Front view), smaller details/important information about them, as well as a few versions of them in a dynamic pose. They can also add other things such as different outfits, forms, etc.
