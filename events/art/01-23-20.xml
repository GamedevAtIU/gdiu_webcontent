    An hour-long discussion / study of art in games, how they help theme them, as well as how art can be used to express a game's narrative without explicitly stating a story aloud. This workshop will cover games and their art styles, and how their character designs, artistic styles, and general aesthetics are used to help progress the story of games and tie in different elements in order to create a more complete story.
