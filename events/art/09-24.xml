    ((
    In this 2 week workshop we will brainstorm level layouts given a theme, and will design a small cubic representation of a building/room/layout of their choice that fits within the chosen theme.
    ))
    ((
    This workshop is designed to help participants practice and/or explore artistic level design, while sticking with a solid and cohesive idea. 
    Additionally, participants will work on interior design, lighting, and atmosphere to create a simple yet professional model of a room.
    ))
    ((
    Week 1 will be focused on drafting and designing the room, and week 2 will be focused on re-creating those drafts in Unity and/or PhotoShop.
