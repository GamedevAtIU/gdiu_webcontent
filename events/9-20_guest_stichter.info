    Our second guest speaker event will feature Bloomington-based boardgame and escape room designer Adam Stichter,
    who will be presenting __"Designing a Card Game from Start to Finish: Iteration, Playtesting, and Production"__.
    He'll discuss a whole-process overview of his latest card game, covering aspects such as prototyping, iterating
    based on player feedback, and the logistics of bringing the game to market.

    GD@IU will also be holding a brownbag roundtable on independent design work with Adam at 5PM on working as an independent designer.
    The location is still being decided, so be sure to keep an eye on [Slack](https://iu-games.slack.com) for more info.
