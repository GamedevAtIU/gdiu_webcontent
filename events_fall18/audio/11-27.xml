    When you look at a picture, what do you hear? How do certain colors "sound"? Do shapes induce certain qualities of sound in our minds? We'll work with the Art SIG to "paint" not only visual, but aural pictures and analyze what is or isn't ""appropriate"" for certain types of images and possibly find unexpected combinations that were unthought of.
