    [Book of the Dead](https://youtu.be/DDsRfbfnC_A) is a demo of Unity's realtime graphics capabilities.
    This blog post by CG and VFX artist [Zdravko Pavlov](https://blogs.unity3d.com/author/zdravkop/) goes into some of the techniques used to create its breathtaking photorealistic assets and VFX.
    Focusing primarily on workflows to create high-fidelity environment assets from still photographs, the article gives great insight into how photogammetry can be used in a game asset pipeline.

    Even if it's not immediately useful due to lack of experience or equipment, definitely give it a read to learn more about modern asset creation techniques!
