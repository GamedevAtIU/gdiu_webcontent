    8-Bit Music Theory provides a comprehensive analysis of techniques used in video game music.
    The channel isolates specific musical elements and discusses their effect on gameplay, story, and the overall feel of a game.

    Basic knowledge of chords, intervals, common music terms, and the ability to read sheet music are recommended in order to fully grasp the material.
    However, the majority of the content on this channel is digestible without a background in music theory and anyone watching should be able to understand the larger points. If you would like to know more about basic music theory, check out [musictheory.net](https://www.musictheory.net/).

    Whether you work in audio or not, this channel should provide you with an understanding of how a composer approaches a game.
