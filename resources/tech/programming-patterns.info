    __Game Programming Patterns__ is a fantastic book by [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=munificentbob) delving into various programming topics that are especially relevant to making games.
    It's available in [print](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582906), as an [ebook](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P5URD96), or for [free to read on the web](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html)!
    With thoughtful explanations, example code, illustrations, and references for further reading, this is an incredibly useful source of information that you'll be coming back to again and again.

    The concepts explored in the book are engine-independent, with example code written in C++, so some basic knowledge of general programming and syntax is needed to fully grasp everything it has to offer.

    Nonetheless, the focus on design-patterns and systems allows the topics to be relevant even to a technically-minded game designer who doesn't plan on being a serious programmer.
