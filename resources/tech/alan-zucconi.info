    [Alan Zucconi](https://twitter.com/AlanZucconi) is an independent developer, lecturer, author, and shader master.
    His blog contains dozens of in-depth tutorials focusing on topics from computer graphics to machine learning, with many examples based in Unity.
  
    Most posts and tutorials require a fairly solid foundation when it comes to programming, though many offer great introductions to more complex topics, [such as writing shaders](http://www.alanzucconi.com/2015/06/10/a-gentle-introduction-to-shaders-in-unity3d/).
    Early access to tutorials and additional resources can also be obtained by [supporting Alan on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/AlanZucconi)!
