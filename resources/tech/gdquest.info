    GDQuest is a great resource for those who want high quality tutorials for [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), and other open source tools for game development.
    Run by [Nathan](https://twitter.com/NathanGDquest), a prominent member in the Godot community, all the tools used to make the tutorials are open source.
    If you want to take a step away from the standard Unity or Unreal engines, this is the place for you.

    Most of the tutorials are based on [beginner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnBioV2HkS8) to [intermediate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AobjNjzZhmo) topics, and will usually require some background knowledge on coding.
    Besides that, GDQuest builds [projects](https://github.com/GDquest/godot-metroidvania-2d) that coincide with their paid courses. You can use the projects free of charge for your own games as well!

    If you want to support GDQuest, take a look at their [shop](https://gumroad.com/gdquest) which has courses and various tools you can use in your projects.
