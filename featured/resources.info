    With the Gamedev@IU's second year fast approaching, we have finally launched the [Resources](/resources.html) section of our website!
    Here you can find a hand-picked collection of tutorials, articles, YouTube channels, and more focused on a wide variety of topics in game development.

    All resources are compiled by Gamedev@IU members, and each has a short description explaining what it is and why you might find it useful.
    With topics ranging from game engine fundamentals to music theory, we're hoping this collection can serve as a reliable source of valuable information for new developers and veterans alike.

    We'll be pushing to get lots more resources added during the coming year, so be sure to check back every now and again to learn something new!
