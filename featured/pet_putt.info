    **Pet Putt** is an adorable mini-golf game by GD@IU member [Rajin Shankar](https://twitter.com/rajinshankar) featuring a wide cast of animal friends and hybrid puzzle-golf gameplay on spherical levels.
    
    After just 3 months of development, **Pet Putt** has already seen positive reactions after a successful showcase at [Indy PopCon](https://popcon.us/indy/) 2019 where it was given the __Best Aesthetic__ award by a panel of industry judges.

    The game is currently in development (using the open-source [Godot](http://godotengine.org) game engine), with a planned release during the first half of 2020. You can follow the game's development on [Rajin's Twitter,](https://twitter.com/rajinshankar) and support it on [Patreon!](https://patreon.com/rajin) Patrons at all tiers also have access to all past, present, and future demo versions of the game.
