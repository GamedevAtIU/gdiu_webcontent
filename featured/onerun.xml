    ((**One Run Dungeon** is a side-scrolling platformer with one goal: beat the game in one run. Armed with just your spellbook and staff, you must defeat the countless hordes sent by the master of the dungeon, The Necromancer, and purge the keep of his evil presence to bring peace to the kingdom.))

    ((Pitched in Fall 2016 by Blake Anderson, who also provided background art, the game was made by Jesse Riggins (lead programmer), Avery Cortell (programmer), Jay Humphrey (character art), Alex Doup (art), Thomas McGrew (music), Ethan Adams (sfx), and Jeremiah Stevens (level design).))

    ((After showcases at Indiana Memorial Union Late Night events and at Indy Pop Con 2017, the game was released through Itch.io and successfully greenlit on Steam!))

    ((__"Inspired by classics such as Contra and Metal Slug, you must run and gun your way through a classical high fantasy dungeon. Fast-paced and challenging, only the most skilled and the most foolhardy can reach the dungeon end in one run.__

    __Everything is a one hit kill - especially you."__))
